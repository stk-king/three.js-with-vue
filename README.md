## 2. Project Introduction
<div>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of creating this repository is to provide a complete set of learning resources for learners, helping everyone to quickly get started with three.js and master its basic concepts and functionalities.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most useful part of this repository is the relevant resource links in the top navigation bar. It collects all the learning materials I've gathered since studying three.js, including a wealth of 3D assets and related tutorials.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help you better understand and apply what you’ve learned, we provide numerous small examples. Each example focuses on a specific feature or effect, allowing you to quickly grasp various techniques of THREE.JS through hands-on practice. For instance, you can learn how to create and manipulate geometries, materials, lights, how to add animations and interactive effects to 3D scenes, and how to load and handle complex 3D models. 
  These projects cover a wide range of application scenarios, guiding you through the entire process of building a 3D application from scratch.
  In these practical projects, you can not only reinforce your knowledge but also enhance your project management and problem-solving skills. These projects will become important achievements for showcasing your skills and provide valuable references for actual development.
